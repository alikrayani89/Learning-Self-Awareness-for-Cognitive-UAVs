# Learning-Self-Awareness-for-Cognitive-UAVs

## This is an active project on learning Self-Awareness models for Cognitive-UAV-Radios
#### Our project aims to solve the Jammer detection, Jammer classification, and Anti-Jamming tasks following unsupervised data-driven approach.

##### In the Dataset folder we shared only one example of the commands received by the UAV during normal and abnormal situation (i.e., under jamming attacks).

##### NOTE: The full Dataset, along with the complete code for jammer detection, jammer classification and anti-jamming, will be available here upon completing the project.
